# The following things are into considerations


instead of creating multiple views create in the Dashboard

	Do the Following 

		Create an edit & Delete Buttons for Each Post and   Team Member  and also for the gallery 
			Then this buttons will only be available to staff or super users only 

			This will Be implemented imediate coz it saves time and also helps solve the templates current state of not rendering


			This Buttons will be added in  the detail view of each and every post and also TeamMember
